Project Hosting 3.0

HTML presentation on the future of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) hosting.

  make html

Proposal
--------

Over the past ten to fifteen years, the landscape of FOSS project hosting has
evolved quite a bit. Starting with just simple file hosting, to dedicated server
hosting and now onto fully featured platforms have changed how FOSS is
hosted. Over the past ten years the OSU Open Source Lab (OSUOSL) hosting has
even shifted towards more cloud-like solutions. But even with these advances,
the needs of many FOSS projects still aren't being met by all of these services.

This session will cover a brief history of FOSS project hosting, explain what
advances have been made in the past few years, cover what I feel projects are
needing that isn't available and finally discuss what I think FOSS project
hosting should look like in the coming years. I also encourage this session to
be an open ended discussion with attendees to get a feel for what they feel is
needed.
